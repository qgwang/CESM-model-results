In both CAM4_results.nc and CAM5_results.nc, the zonal-mean surface temperature responses from regional CO2 forcing experiements are included. 

In addition, in CAM4_results.nc , the T3030_C4 and T3060_C4 correspond to the surface temperature response to 30-30S/N regional forcing and 30-60N/S regional forcing, respectively.
